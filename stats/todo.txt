Pre-reg

- PPt exclusions
	- catch trials
	- PV/WM accuracy
	- 

- All 4 measures: RT/Acc for WM/PV are in Vermeulen et al.

- Power analysis from pilot
- 

- Questions
  - Where to cutoff PV RTs? 
  
	- What is the IRQ hypothesis?
		- In the proposal I put that visualizers will show a larger interaction effect. But I'm not sure that's the case. I would need to think much more deeply about what effects you would expect
			- How are ppts representing the WM info differently?
			- How are they resolving the PV stims differently?
			- How will this lead to different interference effects?


- Improved analyses
  - Preprocessing
    - PV Accuracy: D' or check if ppt results are significantly > mean.
