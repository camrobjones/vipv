Pre-reg

- PPt exclusions
	- catch trials
	- PV/WM accuracy
	- 

- All 4 measures: RT/Acc for WM/PV are in Vermeulen et al.

- Power analysis from pilot

- Questions
  - Where to cutoff PV RTs? [X]
    - A: keep original bounds
  
	- What is the IRQ hypothesis? [X]
		- A: Exploratory, could go multiple ways
		
  - How to pre-register effect structure?
	 - start with maximal and remove ranefs until convergence based on some criteron?
	   - I have a function that does this from the affordances work
	   - which effects to remove first? 3-way seems most relevant but 
	   effectively contains all of the others
	 - parsimonious (only include ranefs that significantly improve full fixef model)?
	 - This is lots of code, I remember trying to write a function that does this and
	   abandoning it...
	
	- How to correct for m.c.? [ ]
	  - FDR on Chi2 tests for 3-way interaction
	
  - Other basic analyses
	  - Should I check for or pre-register any main effects?
	    - fixef structure used? no 3-way interaction?
	    - add to analysis
	    - mention in exploratory as alternative outcome of experiment
	  - Zero-load analysis?
	   - also add to analysis & mention in exploratory
	  - Is it worth trying to replicate the ANOVA analysis?
		
	- IRQ analyses [ ]
	 - Which LME model? Try all 4? (PV acc/rt, WM acc/rt)
	 - Only use those for which we get an effect?
	 - getting ixn ranef requires full ranef structure, might have convergence issues
	 - also look at main effects?
	
	- How to do distributional analysis?
	  - prob of property as covariate
	  - random effects of wm.modality:wm.load by item?
	  
	 
	   



- Improved analyses
  - Preprocessing
    - PV Accuracy: D' or check if ppt results are significantly > mean.

  - IRQ
    - come up with a way to validate by-ppt diffs [ ]
      - e.g. diff in acc in high load between au & pv (pv) - diff between au & pv (au).
      - larger diff of diffs should correlate with large 3-way ixn?
